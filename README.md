🧠 HyperStability Core – Adaptive AI Stability System

---

📌 What is this?

HyperStability Core is an advanced adaptive system that helps AI models stay stable when the environment suddenly changes.
It acts like a "health monitor" + "self-healing engine" for AI — detecting instability and responding before failure occurs.

---

⚙️ How it works?

· 🔁 Uses short-term and long-term error memory
· 📈 Detects instability trends in real time
· ❄️ Activates Freeze Mode or 🚨 Emergency Mode when needed
· 🧠 Adapts its own parameters over time
· 🤝 Works in ensembles (multiple cores) for higher reliability
